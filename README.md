# Customer-Churn-Prediction-APP
This is a web-based application built with Streamlit that predicts customer churn using embeded machine learning models. The app allows users to upload customer data, preprocess it, and run predictions to identify which customers are at risk of churning (stop using a service/product), whose main aim is to ease usage to stakeholders who don't have the technical knowledge to read a Jupyter Notebook
